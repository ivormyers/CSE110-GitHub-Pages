## My Personal Life
I am 21 years old, a third year at UC San Diego, and am studying computer science with a minor in finance. 
I am also heavily interested in **astrophysics** and **photography**, and am actively taking courses to learn more
about those fields. I live in *Mission Beach*, and while that is a commute to school, I love being right next to the beach.
At my house I have a big balcony on the third floor that lets me overlook the area and from the right angle I can take a peek
at the ocean! From the balcony and my living room I love to mix music with my roommates and enjoy the sun when it's out!

## An Inspirational Quote 
> “Do or do not. There is no try.”
Said by the legendary `Yoda`, I find this quote to be very impactful. I have been following his wise words 
of, paraphrased, give it 100 always.
